## Student-Enrollment-Form
In this project I created a enrollment form using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax. Students enter their details and data gets updated inside the JSON Power DB.

In this project, I used 5 methods with JSONPowerDB:
* GET BY KEY --> Get your desired data by inputting the key name
* GET BY RECORD --> Get data by putting the record number
* PUT METHOD --> Insert single record to the DB
* UPDATE IN DB --> Update the data in DB
* REMOVE IN DB --> Remove the data in DB
